Here's a clear summary of your Python code:

This is a simple word guessing game where:
A random word is selected from a list (component, carbon, planet, blood).
The player has 6 chances to guess the correct letters.
The word is hidden using underscores (_) at the start.
The player enters one letter at a time:
If correct, the letter is revealed in the word.
If incorrect, the number of chances decreases.
If the word is guessed before chances run out → "You won"
If not → "Game over", and the word is revealed.
